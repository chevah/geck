General
=======

This page describes the release process and steps to be followed during
development to simplify the release or a final product or library.


Releasing a product usually consists of publishing the following:

* Binary or source archives.
* Documentation, which includes Release Notes, Known Issues and Upgrade Steps.
* Public announcement. Notification email or website news/blog article.


Release Notes
=============

Release notes explain what changed with this version. **Period**.
Release notes are **not** installation, upgrade or configuration.

Each time a branch fixes a bug, adds a new feature or makes any changes
which are visible to end users a new entry is added inside the release notes
file. A release note entry is a summary for one change.

We keep release notes for all versions in a single file so that users can
easily read all changes starting from their version up to latest or a
specific version.

Release notes are grouped in one of the following categories. The category
may be omitted if no changes were added for it. Here are some categories::

* New features
* Bug fixes
* Deprecation
* Removals
* Other changes. Documentation changes.

A marker/tag is added at the end of the sentence to point the ticket ID
associated with this change. Ticket ID marker is not mandatory for new features.

It can be followed by a list of tags to help users understand / filter the
scope of the change. Here are some examples::

* ``[https]`` - for changes affecting only a sub-system.
* ``[aix]`` - for changes affecting only AIX systems.
* ``[windows]`` - for changes affection only Windows system.

Remember your audience/user/clients and write for that audience.

Don't explain all details of the change. When more details are required
use a link to documentation.

All entries should be complete sentences or phrases, ending with a
punctuation mark.

Use present tense as opposed to past tense. The text should state what the
change **does** and not what it **did**.
"Product no longer falls over X." as opposed to "Product fell over X.".

Write text in **resolution** form, describe what impact the change will have
on users. What will the users notice?

If a single sentence isn't clear enough to understand, explaining the
background of the change can be helpful, by adding in
`Previously, X used to do Y.` or `Previously, X used to do Y. Now Z.`.

Don't add low-level, internal details about product logic. Focus on how
the change affects / is perceived by the user.

Here are some examples::

* Support was added for doing / integrating with X.
* Users now can do X.
* It is no longer possible to do Y.
* The text on the ABC form is now Z.
* Reworded text from X to be gender neutral.
* Doing X on a session in state Y no longer gives the XYZ error.
* Fix the XZY error generated when client was doing X on a session in Y state.
* Previously, users were unable to upload files to a folder if they
  had write permissions.
