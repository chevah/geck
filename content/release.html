General
=======

This page describe the release process and things to be followed during
development to simplify the release or a final product or library.


Releasing a product usually consists of publishing the following:

* Binary or source archives.
* Documentation, which includes Release notes, Known Issues and Upgrade steps.
* Public announcement. Notification email or website news/blog article.


Release Notes
=============

Release notes explain what changed with this version. **Period**.
Release notes are **not** installation, upgrade or configuration.

Each time a branch fixes a bug, adds a new feature or makes any change
which is visible to end users a new entry is added inside the release notes
file. A release note entry is a summary for one change.

We keep release notes for all versions in a single file so that users can
easily read all changes starting from their version up to latest or a
specific version.

Release notes are grouped in one of the following categories. A category can
be missing if no changes were added for it. Here are some categories::

* New features
* Bug fixes
* Deprecation
* Removals
* Other changes. Documentation changes.

A marker/tag is added at the end of the sentence to point the ticket ID
associated with this change.

It can be followed by a list of tags to help users understand to scope
if the change. Here are some examples::

* ``[https]`` - for changes affecting only a sub-system.
* ``[aix]`` - for changes affecting only AIX systems.
* ``[windows]`` - for changes affection only Windows system.

Remember your audience/user/clients and write for that audience.

Don't explain all details of the change. When more details are required
use a link to documentation.

All entries should be full proposition or phrases, ending with a
punctuation mark.

Use present tense as opposed to past tense. The text should state what the
changes **does** and not what it **did**.
"Product no longer falls over X." as opposed to "Product fell over X.".

Write text in **resolution** form, describe what impact the change will have
on users. What will the users notice?

If a single sentence isn't clear enough to understand, explaining the
background to the change can be helpful, by adding in
`Previously, X used to do Y.` or `Previously, X used to do Y. Now Z.`.

Don't add low-level, internal details about product logic. Focus on how
the change affects and is perceived by the user.

Here are some examples::

* Support was added for doing / integrating with X.
* Users now can do X.
* It is no longer possible to do Y.
* The text on the ABC form is now Z.
* Reworded text from X to be gender neutral.
* Doing X on a session in state Y no longer gives the XYZ error.
* Fix the XZY error generated when client was doing X on a session in Y state.
* Previously, users were unable to upload files to a folder if they
  had write permissions.
