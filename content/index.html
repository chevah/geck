page_title: Style Guide Overview
---

This pages described the style guides / coding conventions used for the
Chevah project together with some notes about the whole software development
process.

We hope that by following these guide you will find easier to collaborate
with others and improve the quality of your code.

There is a page with common rules and a special page for each language
or technology used by the project.

Please note that these guides are continuously updated according to latest
best practices.

We consider that arguments over these guides are not pointless. In the same
time, it is hard to agree upon a style guide for all projects, and we don't
expect that everyone will agree with the lines from this page.
If you have any comment or suggestions, please get in touch with us. You
can do that over email, or adding an issue or pull request on
`chevah/styleguide - Github`_.

We try to automatically check these rules using `pocket-lint`_.

This is a collection of programming craftsmanship recommendations and ideas.
Please let us know if we fail to properly cite the source.
