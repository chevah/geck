General
=======

* For python we have pocket-lint that checks for PEP8 and some other things.

* `Python PEP 8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_
  **Python base code style guide**.

* Favour single inheritance.

* As the second best, use Mixins to reuse code and avoid multiple inheritance.

* Docstring always use multiline strings with double quotes.

.. sourcecode:: python

    def some_function(argument):
        """
        Single line docstring.
        """


    class SomeClass(ParentClass):
        """
        Quick explanation of the role of this class.

        More details to follow in long paragraphs.
        """

* Class members or instance members can be documented inline using the
  following syntax.

.. sourcecode:: python

    class SomeClass(ParentClass):
        """
        Docstring for class.
        """

        #: Docstring for class member.
        #: Can be on multiple lines.
        class_member = True

* All test functions, test methods, test suites will have docstrings.

* Tests methods will be prefixed with ``test_``.

* Tests suites (test class) will be prefixed with ``Test``.

* Test's docstring should state what is the expected behavior based on
  test's input.

.. sourcecode:: python

    def test_methodName(self):
        """
        When doing this `methodName` will raise an AssertionError.
        """

* When adding linter exception, always add a comment explaining the reason
  why the exception was added.

* Use named parameters for calling methods. This will reduce future
  refactoring effort.

* If a method or class initialization / constructor method has more than 1
  argument always use named parameters for calling that method.

* Try to use single quotes for string. This will make it easier to generated
  quoted text for UI or HTML.

YES

.. sourcecode:: python

    other_var = 'string'
    some_var = 'string "b" yes'

NO

.. sourcecode:: python

    other_bad = "string"
    some_bad = "string 'b' yes"

* As PEP8 recommend, Don't use '\' to split long lines. Wrap long lines is by
  using Python's implied line continuation inside parentheses, brackets and
  braces. More details here:
  http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length

* Multi line split using parentheses, brackets (etc) will follow the normal
  indentation. The code might look ugly and then exceptions are allowed.

* Define all class members at the beginning of class definition.
  Don't interleave methods and class members definition. This should make it
  easy to identify all class members used by the class.

* Define all instance members inside the __init__() method. This should make
  it easy to identity all instance members used by the class and reduce the
  risk of using the same member for more than one purpose.

* Decode all input to Unicode and encode all output from Unicode. Do **all**
  internal text handling in **Unicode**.

.. sourcecode:: python

    input_raw_string = read_from_wire()
    input_string = input_raw_string.decode('utf-8')

    # Only work with Unicode data.
    output_string = process_something(input_string)

    output_raw_string = output_string.encode('utf-8')
    send_to_wire(output_raw_string)

* UTF-8 is not Unicode.
  Unicode is a character set and UTF-8 is a particular way of
  encoding Unicode.


Mixin
=====

As stated by `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin>`_:
Mixins encourage code reuse and avoid well-known pathologies associated
with multiple inheritance.

Mixin is a limited usage of multiple inheritance.

We use mixing to reuse code and they are provide great help writing tests.

Methods from a mixin should not be overwritten by classes using the mixin.

When defining a class using mixins, put first the parent class and then
mixin classes in alphabetical order.

.. sourcecode:: python

    class SomeMixedClass(ParentClass, AnotherMixin, SomeMixin, ZoroMixin):
        """
        A class with `single` inheritance and multiple mixins.
        """

When defining a mixin, document the external class or instance members used
by the mixin.

.. sourcecode:: python

    from some_package import complicated_code_using, complicated_other_using


    class LoginMixin(object):
        """
        Does some kind of work.

        username - account used for authentication.
        password - password for the account
        ssh_key - SSH key for authentication
        """

        def loginWithUsernameAndPassword(self):
            """
            Does something.
            """
            if self.username:
                raise SomeException()

            complicated_code_using(self.username, self.password)

        def loginWithUsernameAndSSHKey(self):
            """
            Does something else.
            """
            complicated_other_using(self.username, self.ssh_key)


Project specific
================

* When default arguments have mutable values they are defined as `None` and
  then assigned the default value.

  Otherwise this can hit us very hard. `More details here
  <http://stackoverflow.com/q/1132941/539264>`_.

.. sourcecode:: python

    def methodName(self, a, b='imutable', c=None, d=None):
        """
        Describe method.
        """
        if c is None:
           c = []

        if d is None:
           d = SomeObject()


Multi line indentation
----------------------

* For now, just some examples:

.. sourcecode:: python

    self.logger.log(
        message_id=factory.number(),
        name=factory.getUniqueString(),
        callback=do_something_else,
        )

Same indentation applies for brackets:

.. sourcecode:: python

    some_list = [
        bla,
        blabla,
        alabala,
        ]

* 2 line code exception. If the parentheses expression fits on one line:

.. sourcecode:: python

    self.logger.log(
        factory.number(), factory.getUniqueString())

* Conditional exception. When indenting parentheses for conditional
  expressions add one extra indent to separate the condition expression
  from the conditional block.

.. sourcecode:: python

    if (somethin_else is None or
            say_something_else is None):
        do_else = nothing
        do_something()

    if (somethin_else is None or
            say_something_else is None or
            we_should_not_have_long_conditionals
            ):
        do_else = nothing
        do_something()

* Class, method and function indentation.

.. sourcecode:: python

    class MyClassName(
            VeryLongParentClass, VeryLongOtherMixin):
        """
        Docstring here.
        """

    def myMethodWithLongArguments(self,
            name=None, other_long_thing=None):
        """
        Docstring here.
        """

    def my_function_with_long_arguments(
            name=None,
            other_long_thing=None,
            other_very_long_argument=None,
            ):
        """
        Docstring here.
        """


Imports
-------

* Imports should be called at the start of each module, the only exception is
  allowed for avoiding circular imports.

* There is one empty line between the import block and module comment.

* The imports blocks are separated by one empty line.

* They will be arranged in 3 major blocks:

  * The first one is for importing from Python standard modules.
  * The second from modules outside of the project (3rd party).
  * The last for modules belonging to the project.

* In each block the modules are sorted in alphabetical order,
  case-insensitive.

* When importing multiple members of a module, if they don't exceed the 78
  characters limit, they will be listed on the same line

* When importing multiple members of a module, and they exceed the 78
  characters limit, they will be listed as a list, with each member on a
  line ending with comma.
