These pages describe the guides used in Chevah project.
They include programming style guides but also notes about working on the project as a whole.

The content might be nitpicking, but we hope that by following these guide
you will find easier to collaborate and improve the quality of your
code and work.

Here are the overall rules of the project:

* Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible.
  (Alan Key)

Based on previous rule the project should fit simple needs but also be able
to scale for more complex usage.

Please note that these guides are continuously updated according to latest
best practices.

We consider that arguments over these guides are not pointless.
In the same time, it is hard to agree upon a style guide for all projects, and we don't
expect that everyone will agree with the lines from this page.
If you have any comment or suggestions, please get in touch with us.

We try to automatically check software development rules using `scame`_.

This is a collection of programming craftsmanship recommendations and ideas.
