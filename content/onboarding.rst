You can see past/active tasks in the `onboarding repo <hhttps://github.com/chevah/onboarding/>`_.

- During onboarding, please arrange and send a calendar invite to weekly meetings with your onboarding supervisor. 

- Be connected to IRC on #chevah while you are "in the office".


1. First stage
--------------

**Create the Github milestone**

To practice your GitHub issue management skills, create your milestone as 'YOUR-NAME Onboarding' in the chevah/onboarding repository and create the initial tickets associated with your onboarding project.

Below is a list of initial issues/tasks to be added in the milestone:

- Comments/suggestions can be added in the ticket.

When submitting repo changes based on your feedback:

- Clone the repository, create a new branch and modify the file/s with your changes.

- Create pull requests (PRs) with these changes. 

- Use the `Github PR template <https://github.com/chevah/styleguide/blob/463556d4e9219e28fd030759ba7af9c0a3ec89e6/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE>`_ and @ mention the oboarding supervisor for review.

**Review and provide feedback for the software**

- Obtain the trial version of the server and client.

- You can choose whichever OS to trial the product in.

- Follow the installation in the documentation.

- Any issues or comments can be mentioned in the Milestone tickets.


**Review and provide feedback for the website.**

When submitting repo changes based on your feedback:

- Clone the repository and create PRs to the right repo.

For any of the tasks above, feel free to check existing or previous milestones for ideas on scope and approach.


2. Know the basic rules
-----------------------

We have basic requirements and practices when working for the Chevah project.
Ask the tech lead for any questions.

* Take note of the `coding conventions <http://styleguide.chevah.com>`_ applied for this project. These general coding conventions are for all 'texts' (code, documentation, etc). 

* There are specific rules that apply to programming languages.
Begin by reading the general `coding conventions <http://styleguide.chevah.com>`_.
  Then review each language specific convention as you will be writing in that language.

* While you are in IRC on #chevah "in the office", set to auto-away to let others know that you are not at the computer.
Set the away status to "busy" (/away busy) if you are working at something and don't want to be disturbed.

* You will use your own hardware for work tasks.
  To compensate for this usage of your hardware we will cover hardware expenses for your home computer.
  If you need a hardware component or peripheral that will help your work related tasks, ask and we can cover those expenses.
  Ask tech lead for details.

* Each task that you are working on should have a ticket in Trac/Github.
If there is no ticket, create one and start the `Ticket Work Flow <http://styleguide.chevah.com/tickets.html>`_. 

* While some tasks are on Github, there is a Trac/Github integration.
See `Overview of the GitHub and Trac integration <http://styleguide.chevah.com/review.html#overview-of-the-github-and-trac-integration>`_.

* Tickets corresponding to you that you are currently working should have the 'owner' value set to your Trac username.

* If a task requires more than two days of work, split the task in multiple ticket each requiring no more than 2 days to complete.

* Please go to the Trac WikiStart page which will contain further links to more details and specific documentation for certain parts of the Chevah project.

* From time to time, check the Trac timeline to stay up to date with latest changes in the project.

* When starting a support ticket, request the OS version architecture used and version of the products.

* Before a Pull Request is closed, it must be reviewed by at least one other team member.
Further info of the `Review process <http://styleguide.chevah.com/review.html>`_.

* Leave days can be requested at any time.
Check the dedicated page in Trac.

* Add your preferred email address in Trac ( Preferences -> General ) to enable email notifications.

* Update your GitHub account to display your full name, and an avatar/picture that is not the default image to help differentiate activity.

* Leave temporary team messages by setting the topic of #chevah IRC channel.


3. Get all your accounts after the initial stage
------------------------------------------------

Once the initial onboarding state is over, you will get full access to the project's resources.

The initial stage is over when all the Onboarding tickets from the milestone dedicated to your onboarding process are finalized.

We are far from single-sign-on and while working on this project you will have many different accounts.

We use Skype for phone calls.
Use the dedicated Skype account as the official tools to collaborate with the team and to make phone calls.

**Ask our system administrators for all of the followings:**

* A project-related email account on Google - enable 2-step auth.

* Update the email account with the standard signature template from the private wiki for all support related emails.

* System administrators will require a chevah.com account as alerts are delivered through the management server.

* Request for VPN certificates to connect to internal servers/services.

* You will need a Trac account setup.
  Trac tickets are used for managing work items since there is no support with the web-based GitHub issue/task/defect management
  Trac also contains wiki pages to other documentation.

* Get to know the team by checking the dedicated page in our private wiki.
