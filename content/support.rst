Before releasing a new version of SFTPPlus products or any fix, we run an automated test suite to validate new features and check for regressions. By knowing a few details about your installations we can configure the test suite to run against a setup similar to your installation. This information will not be shared with any other third party and will be used solely for improving further support for you and development of the product.
