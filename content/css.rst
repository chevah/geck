The CSS Coding conventions are inspired by `Stoyan Stefanov's CSS Coding
Conventions
<http://www.phpied.com/css-coding-conventions>`_

Many of them are automatically checked using pocket-lint that are now
included in the CSS Coding Convention Checker.
Please report any problems that you have with running ``paver lint`` or
if some errors are not identified by ``paver lint``


CSS Syntax Elements
===================

When describing the CSS rules, we will use the following terminology.

    :alt: CSS Selector Graphic

General
=======

* Use C++ comments style (/* comment here \*/) and not C style (//) as they
  are not supported by CSS2 and there are problems in some browsers.
  Also, on LESS C style comments (//) are ignored in the final result.

* Avoid using short CSS notation. They are harder to read and the diff
  generated by changing short notations is less explicit.

* Avoid using IDs when defining styles as they discourage style reuse...
  and then you risk to repeat yourself.

* Put general styles in ''styles.css'' and don't put page specific styles.

* Page specific styles can be included using a different file.

* Use upper letter for color HEX code. Good #F9A0C5 , BAD #f9a0c5

* Don't use color names or rba, just HEX code.

* Use 4 space indentation.

* End a property-value with semi-colon.

* Separate each rule by a blank line.

* Put unrelated rule in different files.

* LESS constants (variables) should be dahs-separated and only low cases:
  ``@good-constant``


CSS Class naming
================

* The most important thing to have in mind is the content nature of the
  HTML document, not its presentation. Selector names should describe the
  content semantic and ``not how it looks``.

* Don't use abbreviation. Use 'header' instead of 'hdr' or 'head'.

* Avoid presentation-specific words in the name,
  like ``blue``, ``text-gray``, or ``light-box``.

* Add namespaces using a dash (-) as a separator.

* Distinct words in the class name are separated by a dash.

* Names are lowercase.


Rules definition
================

* The property will be followed by colons and then a space.

Good::

    .some-class {
        float: center;
    }


Bad::

    .some-class {
        float:center;
    }

* Put each selector on a single line and separate them using comma.
  In this was it is easier to see the selector when using multiple selectors.

Good::

    .some-class,
    p a.class {
        float: center;
    }

Bad::

    .some-class, p a.class {
        float: center;
    }


* The closing bracket should be the only character from a line.
  It should not be indented.

Good::

    .some-class {
      float: center;
    }

Bad::

    .some-class
    {
        float: center;
        }

    .some-class {
        float: center; }

    .some-class, .another { float: center; }

* The opening bracket should be on a the same line as the last selector.

Good::

    .some-class {
        float: center;
    }

    .some-class,
    .another-class {
        float: center;
    }

Bad::

    .some-class
    {
        float: center;
    }


Layout and Typography separation
================================

* Don't put typography properties in the same rule with layout properties 
* The idea it that when you change or remove a typographic rule, the layout will not be affected.
* Use this with moderation, sometimes it is ok to set a margin or padding for H1 or P tag... but don't abuse this.

GOOD::

    product-name {
        font-style: underline:
        color: red;
        }

    highlighted-box {
        float: center;
        width: 30px;
        background-color: blue;
        }

BAD::

    product-name {
        font-style: underline:
        color: red;
        float: center;
        width: 30px;
        background-color: blue;
        }
