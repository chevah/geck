:menu_order: 101

General
=======

* We have 30 days of paid holidays per year. 21 + 9 bank holidays

* All legal leave and bank holidays are put in a common pool of leave days.
  Use them as you like.

* **All** leave days should be logged in the leave spreadsheets,
  including bank holidays.

* Feel free to subscribe to notifications for the leave document.

* When updating the table 2 days before the leave, no need for other notices,
  other than editing the document. Notifications are sent each day.
  You will be contacted if something needs clarification.

* Please try to change the document as soon as possible.


Vacation
========

* It is **strongly recommended** to take at least 5 continuous days of vacation
  to disconnect from the project :)

* A vacation is time to recharge, so stay away from the project / work.

* The team has to learn how to function when people are on vacation and
  unavailable, however important their role is.

* Leave should be taken in collaboration with colleagues to ensure project
  operations are not disrupted.

* When you run out of paid leave days just continue to record your leave days.
  It is **OK** if you need more holiday. Extra holiday is not paid.
  Not paid leave days are subtracted from the salary
  due on the last month of the year.


Other legal leaves
==================

* Other types of legal leaves are added as extra payed leave days.

* 5 days of Marriage leaves

* 3 days for death in the family

* If required, medical leaves are added to the total number of extra paid
  leave days.


Unused leaves
=============

* We **strongly recommend to take all** your allocated leaves.
  Unused leave days for a year are reported to next year,
  up to a total of 5 days.

* You can redeem your unused leave days as normal paid days,
  up to a total of 5 days. Try to plan your time so that you don't end up
  with these remaining days in the first place.
