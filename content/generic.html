General
=======

* Rule #1: Keep it DRY! Don't repeat yourself!

* Rule #2: KISS - Keep it simple, Stupid!

* All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, no
  matter how many people contributed.

* Write all code as it will be written once and read thousand times.
  Write code for maxium readability.

* Write code as it will be used by humans, not a machine. You are not a
  a compiler/interpretor.

* Optimization should come second and only if really needed. Don't Use clever
  tricks and other optimization to early.

* Don't use abbreviation. Use full, meaningful names.

* Don't use tabs for indentation, and in general don't use tabs for anything
  else. The only exceptions are the Makefiles.

* Indent using 4 spaces.

* Maximum line length is 78 characters. This will allow quoting code without
  exceeding 80 characters length.

* Don't mix multiple languages in a single file.

* When reporting a code related problem, use
  `Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable), Example`_

.. _Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable), Example: http://sscce.org


Comments
========

* All comments should be valid sentences and should end with a full stop (.).

* Well commented code is extremely important. Take time to describe
  components, how they work, their limitations, and the way they are
  constructed. Don't leave others in the team guessing as to the purpose
  of uncommon or non-obvious code.

* Place comments on a new line above their subject.

* Avoid end of line comments. End of line comments can be used for lint
  ignores and other hints for automated tools... but not for humans.


Project specific
================

* Each user configuration options should be documentented,
  listing valid values, place where the configuration is located,
  introduction version, version since it was obsolete,
  together with a description of the purpose and effect.

* Each log message should be documented, listing format, introduction version,
  version since it was obsolete, log type, conditions in which it is raised
  and other informations that can be useful for users.

* A logging messages should only be called from a single place in the code.
  This will greatly help with support and debugging.

* A logging message should have a unique ID. This will help the support team
  by pointing a specific event. It will also help when localized logs are
  used.

* If a logging message should be issued from multiple places, move the
  logging call into a dedicated helper method. This will help with
  automatic detection of accidentally using same message ID for different
  logs.

* Components should not issue logging messages that are outside of
  theirs scope, but rather use exceptions to pass the log informations.

* If there are no other options, rather than directly issuing a logging
  message, the component should call a function located in the component
  that 'owns' the log ID that will issue the log.

* All branches will need to use the following convention:
  ``TICKETNO-SHORT_DESCRIPTION``. By having a reference to a ticket, it will
  be much easier to track and keep a record of branch purpose and its
  development.
