This page discuss the code/changes review process as both the person
who requests a reviewer and a person who checks a review.

..  contents::


For person requesting a review
==============================


* Once a task/ticket is done, it should be submitted for review.

* **All** changes should be reviewed prior to be merged or released.

* Before requesting a review you should run a full test on your local
  computer and on all supported platforms.
  Just run ``paver test_remote all`` and Buildbot and GitHub will work
  together to display the results.

* Check the **Reviewer's check list** since those are the things that a
  reviewer will check for sure.

* For Trac: A review request is created by adding the comment and then
  setting the state to 'needs_review'.
  (**don't use keywords**, we are using a strict ticket
  work-flow so use the ticket action form).

* For GitHub: A review request is create using **GitHub Pull requests**.

* When submitting a review for changes not planed in the current milestone,
  update the milestone to the current one. Don't leave the old milestone.

* You can start writing your review request as soon as you start coding on a
  branch. There is no need to wait for feature to be fully implemented and
  tests to pass.
  Writing a review request early, will help you to organize and explain
  the work that you plan to do on the branch.

* When the review is ready to be sent to reviewers, leave a comment
  containing the **needs-review** marker word. It will trigger the review
  request process.

* GitHub inline comments great, and you can add them to help with the
  initial review request. Just **don't abuse them**!
  Think twice before adding an initial inline comments for the review.
  Ask yourself why that comments is needed and why that line is not
  clear. Maybe adding a comment in the code would avoid the
  need for the GitHub inline comment.

* During a review, the reviewer might request changes. You can solve
  the request by either changing the code, or adding a comment with
  the reason why you don't want to change the code. After all requested
  are solved, leave an **new** separate comment containing the keyword
  **needs-review** . This will let reviewers know that you are done and that
  they can check the latest changes.


Review request message
----------------------

When submitting a ticket for review, the review request should contain the
following message (added to the ticket description)::

    {{ '{{{' }}
    #!rst

    Problem description
    ===================

    Describe the problem that these changes wants to solve.
    This content should be created when a ticket is submitted and just link
    the ticket or copy paste the ticket description... or find a way for
    linking this review to a ticket.


    Why we got into this (5 whys)
    =============================

    Mainly used for bugs. Can be removed for task or new features.
    Describe why we got this problem in the first place. What went wrong.
    Repeatedly ask the question “Why” (up to 5 times) to determine to
    cause of this problem.


    Changes description
    ===================

    Describe how the problem was fixed.
    What changes were done.
    What actions were performed.
    What was not done yet and link to the ticket for the still to do work.


    How to try and test the changes
    ===============================

    reviewers @some-dude @another-dude

    How the changes can be tested and verified by team members.

    For end-user changes, how the changes can be tested and verified by
    our users.

* For GitHub review requests, **add the merge commit message as the pull
  request title**. The message should include the ticket ID number.
  Example of merge commit message::

      [#1234] What was done in this branch.

* The commit message should be on a single line and preferable under 100
  characters. The message should be a clearly articulated phrase, summarizing
  changes done in the branch. Further details about the changes can go in
  the release notes or review request body.

* Add the list of persons who should review the branch, using a
  line starting with **reviewers** and followed by GitHub names or each
  reviewer prefixed with **@**.

* If required, using **depends-on** marer, add the list of reviews on which
  this review depends and blocks the merge of this branch.


Small Merge Requests
--------------------

* Ideally you will have many small merge requests, because the bigger they
  get, the more costly they are - now and in the future.

* One merge request should do one thing only.

* The target for a small request is no more than 800 touched lines
  (added + removed).

* When you do a refactoring and you need to rename something in many files,
  do it in a dedicated branch which only deals with the renaming.
  This will help a lot with the review. Land your changed with the ugly
  names and then do a follow-up branch for the renaming.

* Feel free to submit as many merge request as you can. There is a problem
  with the size of a merge request, not with their number :)

* Some reasons for keeping the merge requests small:

  * Large changes are much more likely to do many things.
  * It's harder to understand them.
  * It's harder to review them.
  * It's harder to inspect the main branch to find the merge that.
    introduced a bug.
  * It's more likely to break the build.
  * It's harder to cherry pick code for backporting / supporting old releases.


Merge your branch
------------------

After the merge request and review was approved you need to merge your branch
into master.

After your review request was approved, you can send you branch got PQM
for automatic testing and merging. Use the following command::

    paver pqm GITHUB_PULL_REQUEST_ID

The PQM will check your branch and if it passed all tests, it will be merged
and pushed to master.

If PQM is not enabled for the repo, you will need to do a manual merge.

When doing manual merge using git, don't use fast-forward and don't use the
default commit message. Here is a sample command for merging branch
"1234-what-was-done"::

    git checkout master
    git merge --no-commit --no-ff 1234-what-was-done
    git commit -a -m "[#1234] What was done in this branch."

It is recommended to define a git alias for `merge --no-commit --no-ff`.

A merge commit should have a commit message, in the format::

    [#1234] What was done in this branch.


* **#1234** is the ticket number for this branch. It is used to get more
  details about branch work and review. It can also be used to associate a
  commit to a ticket / branch / review / task and check the history/story of
  that commit.


For person reviewing changes
============================

* The only quality metric of good work / code is **WTF/s**. While doing
  the review you are encourage to keep track of all your first
  contact / view / read impressions and report them in the review feedback.

* Follow procedure recommended in the "How to try and test the changes"
  section, record environment, steps and results and share them through
  a comment.

* In case of errors, leave a comment describing what tests were run, the
  exact steps you took and the actual results.

* If the work is good, you can request the code to be merged by the author
  by setting the state to needs_merge in Trac.

* If the work is good and GitHub pull request was used, leave a comment on
  the pull request page with a line starting with **approved-at 342d345**,
  where **342d345** is the revision at which the branch was approved.

* If no merge is required you can close the ticket as solved.

* If minor changes are required, and they are easy to fix, you cat try to fix
  them. Commit the changes and approve the review at your revision.

* If changes are required, you put the ticket in the **needs-changes** state
  and assign the ticket to the person who can make the required changes.
  When working with GitHub you can request changed by adding
  the **needs-changes** marker word in a comment.

* Don't spend to much time on a review request if it is not clear enough and
  you don't know exactly what to do and how to test.
  This is a problem with the review request and it `needs changes`.


Reviewer's check list
---------------------

* Does the **new** changes comply with latest styleguide ?

* Does the code have tests for new code?

* Does the merge commit message describes what is done by this branch?

* Does the branch name starts with the Trac ticket ID.

* Does **all** tests pass? Does GitHub say that the branch is
  **Good to merge**?

* If there is no ``paver test_remote all`` for the latest code, you can
  either just reject the review, or trigger a test and wait for results.
  **Never** approve a code that is not passing the tests.

* Is there a release notes entry for changes?

* Is there documentation for changes? Does the documentation make sense?

* Are the new event documented?

* Are the removed events documented?
