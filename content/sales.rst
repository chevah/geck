Product Demo
============

Please see /Support/DemoSession for the demo session structure.


Demo text to use
----------------

The demo session content is similar to the documentation in that it is aimed at administrators familiar with file transfer software and protocols and other individuals involved in managing SFTPPlus.

Please do not hesitate to send your criteria of requirements so that we can better answer your questions in advance of the demo - ​support@proatria.com.

For those involved in procurement, please contact the Sales team at ​sales@proatria.com

Pre-demo session:

We recommend obtaining the trial version and installing SFTPPlus until the initial stage: ​https://www.sftpplus.com/documentation/sftpplus/latest/getting-started.html In that way, you are able to continue after the demo session.


Items to consider agreeing to a demo:
-------------------------------------

Is the customer actively pursuing a trial (they have downloaded SFTPPlus) or are they still considering a trial?

If they are still considering a trial, it would be best to get a list of requirements first, and send through response. In this way, we know in advance what they are looking for. Example: A customer will not purchase until they know it provides a Dropbox like feature where they can send public links of their uploads. In this way it is more helpful to find out what they want in advance.

If they are actively in a trial (ie they are at the stage of having already downloaded SFTPPlus in labs), we can proceed.


Is it attended by administrators / individuals involved in managing SFTPPlus?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Like readership of the documentation page, the session should be attended by at least an administrator or individual involved in managing SFTPPlus so that it will increase the chance of knowledge transfer inside their organization during the trial (if more than one more is involved in the trial period) and decrease instances of conducting more than one demo sessions before a purchase (unless it is a large organization with multiple departments etc). Nonetheless you still want as many people attending. It may help decrease mistakes made (and, emails to support in the early stages) when the customer does the initial configuration during the trial.


When demo session is agreed ask for the following:
--------------------------------------------------

* Dates available
* Times available (and local timezone, so that we know what GoToMeeting? toll free / long distance numbers to provide)
* Number of attendees (max 4 attendees incl 1 organiser and 1 co-organiser in case or max 5 attendees if 1 organiser)
* Platform
* Protocols
* List or criteria of requirements to know what to set up in advance


Marketing / Promotional Materials
=================================

Promotions and marketing materials are mainly located in the main website.

It should be as generic and non-technical as possible with links to the
Documentation for more in-depth / technical information.


Announcing a new release to the email list
------------------------------------------

After the website is updated and News item published, we send a newsletter:

1. Go to Campaigns in Mailchimp.

2. Select 'Replicate' besides 'NEW: ACME Release Announcement'.
   If it is a security bugfix, use the Security Advisories email list.

3. Select the News Announcements email list.

4. Update the subject and email with the News text used to announce the
   new release. You can use the text in the News article.

5. Select Send. Before sending the final email, preview first by going
   to 'Preview and Send' on the top menu. Select 'Send a test email'.


Mock ups and designs for the website
------------------------------------

If a change involves a design or content addition (such as an image carousel
in JS), it is a good idea to write/mock up the content first before coding.

In this way, you can check to see what type of code work should be done to best
communicate the content.

Please go to the 'design' repository for sample images and screenshots to use
and add your own samples.

If raw HTML needs to be used, see if custom directives can be used such as:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    :call_for_action: Ready to install our product?
    :call_for_action_link: /pricing/?utm_source=client&utm_campaign=clientbtn&utm_medium=btn#id1
    :call_for_action_button: Ask for a trial

For documentation pages, please do not add raw HTML as the format is designed
to be converted into multiple other formats.
