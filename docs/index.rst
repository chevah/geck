These pages describe the common knowledge we use to run the project.

It can be considered the ultimate textbook for the project.

It is also the law of the project.

In case all team members completely loose their memory and knowledge about the
project, the information from here should help rebuild the project.

They include programming style guides but also notes about working on the project as a whole,
and best practices found while working on the project.

The content might be nitpicking, but we hope that by following these guide
you will find easier to collaborate and improve the quality of your
contribution to the project.

Here are the overall rules of the project:

* Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible.
  (Alan Key)

Based on previous rule the project should fit simple needs but also be able
to scale for more complex usage.

Please note that these guides are continuously updated according to latest
best practices.

We consider that arguments over the information presented here are not pointless.

It is hard to agree upon a style guide for all projects,
and we don't expect that everyone will agree with the lines from this page.
