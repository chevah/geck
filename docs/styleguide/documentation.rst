Documentation
#############


General
-------

We try not to reinvent the wheel and use the `Google documentation style guide <https://developers.google.com/style/>`_.
The Google documentation includes link to Red Hat and Microsoft documentation.

This page includes some project specific requirements.

For documentation source code, we don't enforce a maximum line break.
Use `semantic line breaks <https://sembr.org/>`_ as they will make it easier to read a diff output.

The written language is `British English <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English>`_.

Units are written using the `SI style (English version) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator#Examples_of_use>`_
and International System of Units.


Annotations
-----------

Try to avoid using annotation and always consider whether a `note` or a `warning` can be written as a normal sentence or paragraph.

The following annotation classes are available:

* seealso - green
* tip - green
* note - blue - use to highlight a paragraph.
* danger - strong red
* warning - red
* attention - yellow
* admonition:: Since Version - no color yet
