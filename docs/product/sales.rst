Introduction
============

This page briefly describes operational Sales details.


Product Demo
============


Demo text template to use
-------------------------

Please send your criteria of requirements so that we can
better answer your questions and prepare the session to meet all your
requirements.

For those involved in procurement, please contact the Sales team.

**Pre-demo session:**

We recommend obtaining the trial version and installing until the
`initial stage <https://www.sftpplus.com/documentation/sftpplus/latest/getting-started.html>`_

In that way, you are able to continue after the demo session.

Phone bridge is recommended, if not, use a VOIP headset with dedicated headset.
We do not recommend using the microphone included in laptops due to poor sound
quality.


When demo session is agreed ask for the following:
--------------------------------------------------

* Dates available
* Times available (and local timezone, so that we know what GoToMeeting
  toll free / long distance numbers to provide)
* Number of attendees (max 4 attendees incl 1 organiser and 1 co-organiser in
  case or max 5 attendees if 1 organiser)
* Platform
* Protocols
* List or criteria of requirements to know what to set up in advance


Sending out demo session details
--------------------------------

* Wait for people to join in the first 10 minutes. If there are no-shows, the
  session can be dropped and rescheduled.


Marketing / Promotional Materials
=================================

To save materials, or to obtain past materials, the `design repo <https://github.com/chevah/design>`_ is available.


Announcing a new release to the email list
------------------------------------------

After the website is updated and News item published, we send a newsletter:

1. Go to Campaigns in Mailchimp.

2. Select 'Replicate' besides 'NEW: ACME Release Announcement'.
   If it is a security release, use the Security Advisories email list.

3. Select the News Announcements email list.

4. Update the subject and email with the News text used to announce the
   new release. You can use the text in the News article.

5. Select Send. Before sending the final email, preview first by going
   to 'Preview and Send' on the top menu. Select 'Send a test email'.


Mock ups and designs for the website
------------------------------------

If a change involves a design or content addition (such as an image carousel
in JS), it is a good idea to write/mock up the content first before coding.

In this way, you can check to see what type of code work should be done to best
communicate the content.

Please go to the 'design' repository for sample images and screenshots to use
and add your own samples.

If raw HTML needs to be used, see if custom directives can be used such as:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    :call_for_action: Ready to install our product?
    :call_for_action_link: /pricing/?utm_source=client&utm_campaign=clientbtn&utm_medium=btn#id1
    :call_for_action_button: Ask for a trial

For documentation pages, please do not add raw HTML as the format is designed
to be converted into multiple other formats.


Campaign/Design Outsourcing
---------------------------

Design and campaign work can be outsourced.
Previous freelance contacts can be located in the `Website credit <https://www.sftpplus.com/legal/credits.html>`_ page.

When planning for a campaign:

* First collate the content for the campaign and send to the team

* Once ready, create the initial brief

* The finished materials provided should then be saved in the `chevah/design`
  repository.
