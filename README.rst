This repository is the source for the Chevah G.E.C.K at
https://geck.chevah.com hosted via Read The Docs.

It started as the Python styleguide for the project,
then evolved styleguides were added for more languages, then we added info
about documenting the project, doing a release... and we ended up with G.E.C.K.

The pages are manages using `Sphinx Docs <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_.
